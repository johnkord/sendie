## Authentication & Authorization

### Overview

Sendie uses **Discord OAuth2** for authentication with a **runtime-managed allow-list** for authorization. This provides:

- Familiar login experience (most users have Discord)
- No password management burden
- Admin-controlled access via allow-list
- Audit trail of who was granted access and by whom

### Architecture

```

                    │ Allow-List  │
                    │ (In-Memory) │
                    └─────────────┘
```

### Key Components

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `AllowListService` | `Services/AllowListService.cs` | In-memory allow-list with config-loaded admins |
| `AllowListHandler` | `Authorization/AuthorizationHandlers.cs` | Checks if user is on allow-list |
| `AdminHandler` | `Authorization/AuthorizationHandlers.cs` | Checks if user is an admin |
| `AuthService` | `client/src/services/AuthService.ts` | Frontend auth API calls |
| `authStore` | `client/src/stores/authStore.ts` | Zustand store for auth state |
| `ProtectedRoute` | `client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` | Route protection wrapper |
| `UserHeader` | `client/src/components/UserHeader.tsx` | User info + logout button |
| `AdminPage` | `client/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx` | Admin panel for user management |

### Authorization Policies

- **`AllowedUser`**: User is authenticated AND on the allow-list
- **`Admin`**: User is authenticated AND in the config-defined admin set

### Cookie-Based Sessions (Not JWT)

**Decision**: Use encrypted cookies instead of JWT tokens.

**Rationale**:
- SignalR WebSocket connections work better with cookies (automatic inclusion)
- Stateless anyway - claims encrypted in cookie, no server-side session store
- Simpler implementation - no token refresh logic needed
- HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS token theft

**Configuration**:
```csharp
options.Cookie.Name = "Sendie.Auth";
options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax;
options.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromHours(24);
options.SlidingExpiration = true;
```

### Data Protection (Cookie Encryption)

**Problem**: ASP.NET Core encrypts cookies using Data Protection keys. By default, these keys are stored in-memory and regenerated on each restart, causing all users to be logged out.

**Solution**: Persist Data Protection keys to the filesystem.

```csharp
var dataDirectory = builder.Configuration["DataDirectory"] 
    ?? Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "data");
builder.Services.AddDataProtection()
    .SetApplicationName("Sendie")
    .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(Path.Combine(dataDirectory, "keys")));
```

**Important**: The `DataDirectory` environment variable must point to persistent storage (e.g., a PersistentVolumeClaim in Kubernetes). Without this, users will be logged out every time the server restarts.

### Discord OAuth Setup

1. Create application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Add redirect URLs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5000/signin-discord`
   - Production: `https://sendie.curlyquote.com/signin-discord`
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to configuration

---

## Security Improvements

### 1. Cryptographic Session IDs (Implemented)

**Problem**: Original implementation used `System.Random` for session IDs, which is predictable.

**Solution**: Use `RandomNumberGenerator` (CSPRNG) with 128-bit entropy.

```csharp
public string GenerateSessionId()
{
    var bytes = RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes(16); // 128 bits
    return Convert.ToBase64String(bytes)
        .Replace("+", "-")
        .Replace("/", "_")
        .TrimEnd('=');
}
```

**Location**: `Services/SessionService.cs`

### 2. Discord Identity System (Implemented)

Replaced the incomplete ECDSA identity verification with Discord OAuth2. See [Authentication & Authorization](#authentication--authorization).

### 3. Filename Sanitization (Implemented)

All filenames received from peers are sanitized before use to prevent:
- **Path traversal attacks**: `../../../etc/passwd` sequences removed
- **XSS attacks**: `<script>` and other dangerous characters stripped
- **Filesystem issues**: Null bytes, control characters, reserved chars removed
- **Length attacks**: Truncated to 255 characters

**Location**: `client/src/utils/formatters.ts` - `sanitizeFilename()`

**Applied in**: `FileTransferService.ts`, `MultiPeerFileTransferService.ts`

### 4. Rate Limiting (Implemented)

In-memory sliding window rate limiter to prevent abuse:

| Policy | Limit | Window | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| SessionCreate | 10 | 1 hour | Per IP |
| SessionJoin | 30 | 1 minute | Per IP |
| SignalingMessage | 100 | 1 second | Per connection |
| IceCandidate | 200 | 1 second | Per connection |

**Location**: `Services/RateLimiterService.cs`

**Applied to**: REST endpoints (returns HTTP 429) and SignalR hub methods (throws HubException)

### 5. Remaining Security Considerations

From the original security analysis, these items remain for future consideration:

- **File consent enforcement**: Currently client-side only; could add explicit accept/reject UI
- **File integrity verification**: Add SHA-256 hash verification for transferred files
- **Session expiration**: Sessions should auto-expire after inactivity

### 6. Privacy vs Anonymity (Clarification)

Sendie is **privacy-focused** but **not anonymous**:

| Property | Status | Explanation |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Server can see files | ❌ No | Files transfer P2P, never through server |
| Server logs transfers | ❌ No | Only session existence is known |
| Transfers are encrypted | ✅ Yes | DTLS (WebRTC standard) |
| Peers see each other's IPs | ✅ Yes | Required for P2P connections |
| Works with Tor | ❌ No | Tor disables WebRTC |
| Works with VPN | ✅ Yes | With WebRTC leak protection |

See `docs/what-is-sendie.md` for user-facing documentation on this topic.

## Decision Log

### 2025-12-24: File Queue and Broadcast Mode

**Context**: Users wanted to prepare files for transfer before recipients join, eliminating the wait time between connection and transfer start.

**Decision**: Implement a file queue system with two modes:
1. **One-time queue**: Files queued when alone, auto-sent to first peer that connects, then cleared
2. **Broadcast mode**: Files marked as broadcast are sent to every new peer that joins

**Rationale**:
- Reduces friction for senders who know what they want to share
- Broadcast mode is useful for distributing files to a group (e.g., meeting materials)
- Queue clears after first send by default to prevent unintended re-sends
- Broadcast mode is opt-in toggle that persists files until disabled

**Implementation**:
- `QueuedFile` type in `types/index.ts` with `isBroadcast` flag
- `appStore.ts` - `queuedFiles[]`, `broadcastMode`, actions for queue management
- `FileQueue.tsx` - UI for viewing/managing queued and broadcast files
- `handleDataChannelOpen` in `MultiPeerSessionPage.tsx` triggers auto-send
- Tracks which peers received broadcast files to prevent duplicates

### 2025-12-24: Auto-Receive Toggle

**Context**: Some users may not want to automatically receive incoming files (e.g., in untrusted sessions).

**Decision**: Add per-user auto-receive toggle (enabled by default).

**Rationale**:
- Default behavior (auto-receive ON) maintains simplicity for most users
- Toggle in session header for quick access
- When disabled, incoming file transfers are silently ignored (no notification, no pending state)
- Does not persist across sessions (resets to ON)

**Implementation**:
- `autoReceive` state in `appStore.ts`
- `setAutoReceiveChecker()` on `MultiPeerFileTransferService` 
- `initializeIncomingTransfer()` checks auto-receive before accepting files

### 2025-12-24: Host-Only Sending Mode

**Context**: Hosts sometimes want to distribute files to a group without allowing others to send files (e.g., one-way file distribution).

**Decision**: Add host-only sending toggle that restricts file sending to the session host.

**Features**:
- Toggle in Host Controls panel (next to Lock button)
- When enabled, only the host can send files
- Non-hosts see disabled drop zone with "Only the host can send files" message
- Can be toggled on/off at any time during the session
- Not enabled by default

**Implementation**:
- `Session.IsHostOnlySending` - Boolean field on session model
- `SignalingHub.EnableHostOnlySending()` / `DisableHostOnlySending()` - Only callable by host
- `OnHostOnlySendingEnabled` / `OnHostOnlySendingDisabled` - Broadcast to all peers
- Client tracks `isHostOnlySending` in connection state
- FileDropZone disabled for non-hosts when enabled
- File queue also disabled for non-hosts

**Rationale**:
- Server-enforced via hub methods (only host can toggle)
- Client-enforced via UI (prevents accidental drops)
- Useful for webinar-style file distribution
- Pairs well with Broadcast Mode for automated distribution

### 2025-12-24: Multi-Peer Mesh Topology

**Context**: Users requested ability to share files with more than 2 people in a single session.

**Decision**: Implement full mesh WebRTC topology where each peer connects to all others.

**Rationale**:
- Each peer maintains N-1 connections (where N = total peers)
- Maximum 10 peers per session (configurable via `MaxPeers`)
- Files are broadcast to all connected peers simultaneously
- Simpler than SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) - no relay server needed
- Mesh works well for small groups; SFU would be better for large groups (10+)

**Trade-offs**:
- Sender bandwidth scales with peer count (uploads to each peer)
- Connection overhead increases quadratically with peer count
- Ideal for 2-10 peers

**Implementation**:
- `MultiPeerWebRTCService.ts` - manages Map of peer connections
- `MultiPeerFileTransferService.ts` - broadcasts files to all peers
- `MultiPeerSessionPage.tsx` - shows peer list with SAS codes
- Server tracks multiple peers per session with `MaxPeers` limit

### 2025-12-24: WebRTC "Glare" Prevention

**Context**: When both peers tried to connect simultaneously, both would create offers, causing connection failures ("glare" condition).

**Decision**: Only joining peers create offers; existing peers wait for incoming offers.

**Rationale**:
- Deterministic offer/answer roles prevent race conditions
- New peer joins → creates offers to all existing peers
- Existing peers receive offers and respond with answers
- Server notifies existing peers of new peer arrival

### 2025-12-24: Public Session Joining

**Context**: Original design required authentication for both session creation and joining.

**Decision**: Make session joining public; only session creation requires Discord auth.

**Rationale**:
- Users want to share files with people who may not have Discord
- Link-based sharing is the core UX (just share a URL)
- Creator authentication provides accountability
- Session IDs are cryptographically random (128-bit), so guessing is infeasible

**Implementation**:
- Removed `[Authorize]` from SignalingHub
- Session GET endpoint is public
- Session POST requires authentication
- ICE servers endpoint is public

### 2025-12-24: Deployment-Specific Secrets

**Context**: Admin user IDs should not be hardcoded in committed config files.

**Decision**: Move admin IDs to `secrets.yaml` (gitignored) instead of `configmap.yaml`.

**Rationale**:
- `secrets.yaml` is already deployment-specific and not committed
- Follows same pattern as Discord credentials
- Template file (`secrets.yaml.template`) documents the required fields
- Each deployment can have different admins

### 2025-12-24: OAuth Callback Ingress Route

**Context**: After Discord OAuth, callback to `/signin-discord` was being served by nginx (client) instead of ASP.NET (server).

**Decision**: Add explicit ingress route for `/signin-discord` to server backend.

**Rationale**:
- OAuth callback must be handled by ASP.NET auth middleware
- Client catch-all route (`/`) was intercepting it
- Explicit route ensures callback goes to server

**Ingress routes to server**:
- `/api/*` - REST API
- `/hubs/*` - SignalR WebSocket
- `/signin-discord` - OAuth callback
- `/health` - Health check

### 2025-12-24: ForwardedHeaders for HTTPS Detection

**Context**: Behind nginx ingress with TLS termination, ASP.NET saw HTTP requests and generated wrong OAuth redirect URIs.

**Decision**: Add ForwardedHeaders middleware to read `X-Forwarded-Proto` header.

**Rationale**:
- Ingress terminates TLS, forwards HTTP to pods
- Without ForwardedHeaders, OAuth callback URL was `http://` instead of `https://`
- Middleware reads `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` and sets correct scheme

### 2025-12-24: K8s Recreate Deployment Strategy

**Context**: RollingUpdate strategy was failing due to resource constraints (new pod couldn't start while old was running).

**Decision**: Use `Recreate` strategy for server deployment.

**Rationale**:
- Small AKS cluster with limited resources
- Recreate stops old pod before starting new one
- Acceptable for this application (brief downtime during deploys)
- Could switch to RollingUpdate with larger cluster

### 2025-12-24: P2P Anonymity Limitations (Documented)

**Context**: Users may expect Sendie to provide anonymity since it's "privacy-focused."

**Decision**: Document clearly that Sendie does NOT provide anonymity—peers see each other's IP addresses.

**Rationale**:
- WebRTC requires exchanging IP addresses during ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)
- This is fundamental to P2P — direct connections require knowing where to connect
- Tor Browser won't work because it disables WebRTC to prevent IP leaks
- VPNs work but require WebRTC leak protection enabled

**Privacy model clarification**:
- ✅ **Server-blind**: We can't see your files
- ✅ **Encrypted**: All transfers use DTLS
- ❌ **Anonymous**: Peers see each other's IPs (or VPN exit IPs)

**Compatibility matrix**:
| Network Environment | Works? | Anonymity |
|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| Regular browser | ✅ | None — real IP visible |
| VPN + leak protection | ✅ | VPN exit IP visible |
| Corporate/University NAT | ✅ | Shared IP |
| Mobile CGNAT | ✅ | Carrier IP (shared) |
| Tor Browser | ❌ | N/A — WebRTC disabled |

**Recommendation for anonymity-seeking users**: Use a VPN with WebRTC leak protection enabled. This is documented in `docs/what-is-sendie.md`.

### 2025-12-24: Discord OAuth over Custom ECDSA

**Context**: Original design had incomplete ECDSA-based identity verification.

**Decision**: Replace with Discord OAuth2 + allow-list.

**Rationale**:
- Most target users already have Discord accounts
- Proven security model vs. home-grown crypto
- Allows runtime management of authorized users
- Admins defined at config-time, users at runtime

### 2025-12-24: Cookies over JWT

**Context**: Needed to choose session mechanism for Discord OAuth.

**Decision**: Use encrypted cookie-based sessions.

**Rationale**:
- SignalR WebSocket connections automatically include cookies
- JWT would require manual token injection for SignalR
- Both are stateless; cookies simpler for this use case
- HttpOnly cookies more secure against XSS

### 2025-12-24: Friendly Names for Peer Identification

**Context**: Users couldn't see their own identifier in multi-peer sessions, making coordination difficult (e.g., "which one am I?"). The existing SAS code is shared between two peers for security verification, not individual identification.

**Decision**: Derive human-readable "friendly names" from each peer's public key.

**Format**: `{adjective}-{noun}` (e.g., "cosmic-tiger", "swift-falcon")

**Rationale**:
- Users need to identify themselves to coordinate with others
- SAS codes (4 words) verify connections between TWO peers — not suitable for individual identity
- Friendly names (2 words) identify a single peer — derived from their individual key
- 64 adjectives × 64 nouns = 4,096 unique combinations (sufficient for small sessions)
- Deterministic: same public key always produces same name

**Implementation**:
- `CryptoService.generateFriendlyName(publicKeyJwk)` - hashes key, maps to adjective-noun
- `PeerConnectionState.friendlyName` - stored per peer
- `ConnectionState.localFriendlyName` - user's own name shown prominently
- `PeerList.tsx` - displays "You are: {name}" at top, uses friendly names for peers

**UX improvements**:
- Users see their own identity immediately upon joining
- Can tell others "I'm cosmic-tiger" for coordination
- Clear separation: friendly name = who you are, SAS code = security verification

### 2025-12-24: In-Memory Allow-List

**Context**: Need to store authorized users.

**Decision**: In-memory ConcurrentDictionary with config seeding.

**Rationale**:
- Simple, fast, no external dependencies
- Single replica deployment (no shared state needed)
- Config-defined admins and initial users
- Future: Could add Redis/database for persistence

### 2025-12-24: Session Host Controls (Lock/Unlock, Kick)

**Context**: Session creators had no control over who could join their sessions after creation. Unwanted participants could join if they had the link.

**Decision**: Add host controls allowing the session creator to lock/unlock sessions and kick peers.

**Features**:
- **Lock/Unlock**: Prevent new peers from joining while allowing existing transfers to continue
- **Kick**: Remove a specific peer from the session (they're redirected to home page)
- **Host Badge**: Visual indicator showing who the session host is

**Implementation**:
- `Session.IsLocked` - Boolean field on session model
- `Session.CreatorConnectionId` - Tracks who created the session (first peer to join)
- `SignalingHub.LockSession()` / `UnlockSession()` - Only callable by host
- `SignalingHub.KickPeer(targetPeerId)` - Removes peer, sends `OnKicked` event
- Client shows Host Controls panel with lock toggle
- Client shows host badge (👑) on local user and peer cards

**Why not Ban?**:
- Considered but decided against for simplicity
- Kick + Lock covers 90% of use cases
- Ban would require tracking by IP or public key hash
- Sessions are ephemeral (max 4 hours) so persistent bans less useful
- Can reconsider if real-world abuse patterns emerge

**Rationale**:
- Gives hosts control without requiring authentication for joiners
- Lock button provides quick "close the door" after expected participants join
- Kick handles unwanted participants without affecting others
- Host is automatically the first person in the session (creator)

### 2025-12-24: User Secrets for Local Dev

**Context**: Need secure way to store Discord credentials locally.

**Decision**: Use .NET User Secrets.

**Rationale**:
- Built into .NET, no extra tooling
- Stored outside repo (no gitignore issues)
- Automatically loaded in Development environment
- Standard practice for .NET development
